            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S the vnskillfull caruer that
wanteth both Arte and iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
cunninglie to contriue
the worke he taketh in hande,
&amp; yet able to iudge of his owne
imperfection, findeth meanes,
(for the better aduauncement
thereof) to erecte the ſame on
the toppe of ſome high piller,
or ſuch like place, where the faulte cannot eaſilie be
perceiued by the curious beholders: Euen ſo (Right
worſhipfull) hauing perfected this my <hi>Youthes witte,</hi> Or
<hi>witte of Greene Youth,</hi> (a fitte name for ſo ſimple a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect)
I was moued, partlie of mine own accord, (know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
your worthineſſe, which well appeareth to the
worlde) and partely at my frendes requeſte (that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded
me you would courteouſlie accept it) to make
my ſpeciall choiſe of your worſhippe, to ſupporte, and
ſuſtain by your vertue &amp; worthines, this ſimple worke,
vnworthy ſuch a Patrone. For though it be ſufficiently
fraught with a few prettie conceites, yet can I not my
ſelfe in priuie conceite, ſo much loue or like it (as the
Crow that thinketh her own birde fayreſt) to ſuppoſe,
it may well ſwimme through the ſenſural ſeas of ſuch
as haue either high Forheads, and ſharpe wittes, or
wante of iudgement, with euil to<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gues, vnles it be guy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded

May it therefore pleaſe your worſhippe (of youre
courteſie) to allow my good wil, and hereafter to like
of the worke, I ſhall haue what I eſpecially wiſh for in
this behalfe, and care the leſſe for the ſharpe cenſure
of ſuch as diſfauoure my doinges. For I know that
<hi>Apollo</hi> for all his ſkill, refuſed not to heare the hariſhe
Pipe of <hi>Pan,</hi> though but a rurall God. And <hi>Pallas,</hi>
though in Arte ſhe farre ſurpaſſed <hi>Arachne,</hi> yet vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafed
ſhe to handle the thridde of her ſpinninge, and
to ſay that her webbe was wel wrought, and cunning<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
contriued. And <hi>Xerxes,</hi> a mightie Prince, thought
no leſſe well of the poore man that preſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted him with
a handfull of water, then he did of the greateſt giftes
that euer anie beſtowed vpon him. And truth it is,
that ſuch men as are either guyded by the rule of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
or indued with the courteous giftes of gratitude,
doe more regarde the minde of the geuer, then the
worthe of the preſente. Therefore to conclude, I hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blie
beſeech your worſhippe, with the force of youre
vertue, to defende my YOVTHES WIT from
the malitious reportes of thoſe that miſlike, and ſeeke
to diſgrace it: And in ſo doing, your worſhippe ſhall
geue me incouragemente, hereafter to attempte a
better worke then this is: For the ſmalleſt tree, (if it
be well proyned) will proſper, and verie light laboure
not miſlyked, is likely to grow ſo farre onwarde, as to
become Induſtrie it ſelfe. And thus abruptlie fini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing

            <p>MAy it pleaſe you amongſt other bookes, ſome good, ſome
bad, to peruſe this my <hi>YOVTHES WIT,</hi> Or
<hi>WIT OF GREENE YOVTH,</hi> in ſuch ſorte as they
were woonte to ſuruey the Tables of <hi>Phidias,</hi> and the Pictures
of <hi>Prazitiles,</hi> that had before ſeene the excellent workeman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhippe
of <hi>Appelles,</hi> betweene whome and the other, though
there were as greate difference, as betweene the leaſt twinck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
Starre, and the Sunne it ſelfe, yet did they both like
of the one as they had cauſe, and looke on the other when
occaſion ſerued. The praiſe that <hi>Homer</hi> purchaſed by his
skill in Poetrie, was not ſo great, that it could quite diſgrace the
doinges of his Inferiors: For <hi>Meuius</hi> and <hi>Bauius</hi> (though
not ſo excellent) yet were they allowed for Poets of manie: ſome
haue deſired to heare an Orator of euill vtterance, to the ende
they might afterwardes take the more pleaſure, when they hard
one pleade, that could pronounce his wordes diſtinctlie, and with
good diſcretion. <hi>Cato</hi> the wiſe man of <hi>ROME,</hi> was wonte
oftentimes to vaunte, that he learned no leſſe good by conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
with fooles, and ſpying their faultes, then he gote wiſdome by
the wyſeſt, and thoſe of beſt behauiour: And therefore, I am
thus farre to intreate you for this my ſimple worke, that if it be
not in your conceates, worthy to be likened to <hi>Appelles</hi> Pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tornes,
ye will vouchſafe, at idle times, to gaze vpon <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

               </gap>, as a table
of <hi>Phidias</hi> or <hi>Praxatiles.</hi> If it beare not the beautie of a ſunne
beame, then liken it to the leaſt ſtarre that ſhineth. If it be not
comparable to <hi>Homers</hi> poeſie, that was taken as a ſufficiente
dowrie with his daughter in mariage: yet permit it to be allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
of ſome, as were the verces of <hi>Bauius</hi> and <hi>Meuius,</hi> If it
taſte nothinge at all of a good Orator, yet accepte of it, till a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
come in place. If it teache no wiſe conceate, yet eſteeme of it
as a patterne of my fooliſh conceate, wherby ſuch as haue iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mente,
may conceaue (if they will) a platforme of ſome wisdome.
Beare with me, I pray you, though I ſeeme in this linking of my
lines together, halfe to riddle with you, and accepte my good
will, For I haue beene as much troubled in contriuing theſe my
conceites, as they that buylde caſtles in <hi>SPAYNE</hi> (as the
French Prouerbe vnderſtandeth it) Or, as a Henne with two
Chickens, And ſo fare ye well.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N the citie of <hi>Ceſſenna</hi> not long

a Sonne and a Daughter, and
as betwene the fathers there had

growe and increaſe betwene their children, ſpecially be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twene
their Daughters: For <hi>Camilla</hi> the Daughter of
<hi>Gerardo,</hi> (by meanes of her brothers abſence, who was
reſident at <hi>Rome,</hi> where he had continued a long time as
factor for his father,) hauing no bodie to kéepe her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie
in his abſence, reſorted diuers times to <hi>Cornelia,</hi>
who (her father being dead) was then only Miſtres of the
houſe, which her brother <hi>Hannibal</hi> (as ſole inheritour of
all his goodes) did hold and enioy after his deceaſe: The
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:25404:6"/>
continuall conuerſation of theſe two gentlewomen as it
ingendred betwene them ſuch perfect amitie as could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer

<hi>Hannibal,</hi> which by the contemplacion of <hi>Camillas</hi>
bewtie, ſo increaſed from time to time, and in the end toke
ſuch déepe roote, that it could not poſſiblie be remoued:
This ſtraunge paſſion ſo tormented the mind of the poore
gentleman (who had neuer before bene acquainted with
the like) that neglecting all his neceſſarie affaires, he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
his whole care and ſtudie to pleaſe and pleaſure his

<hi>Signor Hannibal</hi> perceiuing, and not ſatisfied therewith
would faine haue made his meaning more apparant, cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
ſuch comfort as the neceſſitie of his cauſe required,
but the feare he had to offend, (and ſo to loſe the fauour
whereof he was aſſured, by her continuall preſence) did
ſtill deteyne him, and would neuer ſuffer him to proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute
his purpoſe: Thus hanging betwene hope and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpaire,
thone pricking him forward, the other pulling him
backe, imagining now one thing, now an other thing, and
neuer reſoluing fully vpon any thing, he became at laſt
ſo melancolike with muſing &amp; imagining on this matter,
that loſing his appetite to meate, and deſire to ſléepe, at the
laſt he grew ſicke, and by litle and litle waſted away as
ſnow againſt the ſunne.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Cornelia</hi> ſéeing her brother thus pained applied her
ſelfe (like a naturall ſiſter) to prouide him all things that
ſhe thought méete for the recouerie of his health, by Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicke
or otherwiſe, but his diſeaſe procéeding of no natural

was for the moſt part, that it procéeded of ſome paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion

could by no meanes imagine vppon what occaſion he
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:25404:6"/>
ſhould be ſo diſquieted; to vnderſtand the truth, ſhe lay
continually vpon him, vſing all the perſwaſions that poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly
ſhe might, to make him reueale vnto her the cauſe of
this his grieuous malladie, which at the laſt he did with
much a do, telling her, that it was only for the loue he bare
to her frend <hi>Camilla,</hi> which he had ſought by all meanes
poſſible to ſuppreſſe, but could not, being continuallie
renewed by the dayly contemplacion of her celeſtiall

               <p>
                  <hi>Cornelia</hi> hearing theſe wordes, vttered by her ſicke
brother, with grieuous ſighes and great aboundaunce of
teares, knowing that it was then no time to reproue his
folly, but rather to prouide a remedie for thextreame miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe
whereunto he was ſo vnhappely fallen, comforted
him with ſwéete wordes, exhorting him to plucke vp his
ſpirites, and ſéeke ſome meanes to remedie his griefe:
Whereunto he replied that he knew not how to eaſe him
ſelfe, vnleſſe it would pleaſe her to diſcouer his affection to
her frend <hi>Camilla,</hi> and perſuade her to take ſome pitie v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon

               <p>
                  <hi>Cornelia</hi> that loued her brother as her owne life, gaue
him her promiſe that when opportunitie ſhould ſerue, ſhe
would ſatiſfie his deſire, and make his eſtate ſo well kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen
to her in whom his only hope of helpe conſiſted, that
ſhe had no doubt but that her tender hart would be mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
to take compaſſion vpon him, when ſhe ſhould per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue
that his intent was honeſt, and his affection in dede
vnfamed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hannibal</hi> was ſomewhat comforted with theſe kind

<hi>Camilla</hi> and his ſiſter <hi>Cornelia,</hi> thought her wordes
might worke ſuch effect with her, that he ſhould eaſily ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine

               <p>
                  <hi>Cornelia</hi> ſhortly after being with her frend <hi>Camilla</hi>
talking of diuers matters (as women will do when they

brothers caſe vnto her, tellinge her what ſtraunge tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes
he endured for her ſake, affirming that without
her helpe he was like to languiſh without all hope of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy,
praying her therefore moſt inſtantly to haue pitie
vpon him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Camilla</hi> though ſhe liked not well of theſe words that
<hi>Cornelia</hi> had vſed vnto her, yet ſéeing her to be greatly
grieued for her brothers ſickenes, ſhe did y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> rather hold her
excuſed, and would not greatly reproue her, but gaue her
to vnderſtand that ſhe tooke ſmall delite in ſuch amorous
ſuters, praying her from thenceforth to trouble her no

but loſe her labour, and be farre enough from obtaining
that ſhe ſought.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Cornelia</hi> though ſhe were not ſatisfied with this aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer,

durſt ſhe ſhewe her brother what aunſwere <hi>Camilla</hi>

watching, and the great paines that ſhe tooke with him
continually during the time of his ſickenes, or by ſome
griefe ſhe conceaued in the vncourteous aunſwer of her
frend <hi>Camilla,</hi> or becauſe ſhe ſaw no meanes to remedy
her brothers ſeaceleſſe torment, ſhe fell ſhortly after into a

hearing his <hi>Camillas</hi> voice, aſked his ſiſter <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelia,</hi>
who was with her, who aunſwered him that there

at that preſent, calling his wits together and taking
more courage vnto him then he was accuſtomed to haue
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:25404:7"/>
in this caſe, taking his lute in his hand he began to ſing
as followeth:

                     <l>YEld me my heart, yeld me my libertie.</l>
                     <l>From out this priſon let me paſſe againe,</l>
                     <l>That for thy ſake, bide ſuch extreamitie,</l>
                     <l>As neuer mortall man might well ſuſtaine.</l>
                     <l>If thou haſt vowd to tread Dianas trace,</l>
                     <l>If crueltie increaſe in thee by kinde,</l>
                     <l>If thou diſdaine to graunt thy ſeruaunt grace,</l>
                     <l>Or canſt not lodge ſuch, liking in thy minde:</l>
                     <l>Yeld me my hart, that wholy then I may</l>
                     <l>Geue vp the ghoſt, when as my race is runne,</l>
                     <l>Which now for loue doth languiſh night and day,</l>
                     <l>And hath no power thoſe painfull paines to ſhunne.</l>
                     <l>But if thy purpoſe be to keepe it ſtill,</l>
                     <l>Yet vſe it better then thou didſt before.</l>
                     <l>To vex the wight, no doubt the deede were ill,</l>
                     <l>That well deſerues, thou ſhouldeſt eſteeme him more.</l>
                     <l>Then, in thy breaſt, as reaſon doth require,</l>
                     <l>My grieued hart vouchſafe to lodge at laſt,</l>
                     <l>That I may ſay, thou did'ſt not deſire,</l>
                     <l>Nor wiſh the woes, that I ſo long did taſt,</l>
                     <l>But that thy loue though it were long conceald,</l>
                     <l>Was firmely ſixt, and plainly now reueald.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>And then began on the other ſide of the wall, with
wordes interrupted with ſighes and great abundaunce of
teares, to declare to <hi>Camilla</hi> his amorous and extreame
paſsion, humbly beſéechinge her to take pitie vpon him,
and not to ſuffer him to finiſh his miſerable life in the
flower of his youth, through her cruelty and want of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſsion.</p>
               <p>Of ſuch force were theſe his prayers, that mollefying
her tender hart, (which ſhe felt ſodainly enflamed with an
vnaccuſtomed heate) ſhe thoughte it greate crueltie not to
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:25404:8"/>
haue compaſsion vpon him, and no leſſe ingratitude to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
him that fauour which his entire affection and perfecte
loialtie had wel deſerued: wherefore in frendlye wiſe ſhe
ſpake vnto him after this manner: <hi>Senior Hanniball,</hi> I
am contented to allow of your wordes, and cannot but
like well of your courteous offer, not ſuppoſing you to be
one of thoſe that wyth leude practiſes doe ſeeke to deceiue
ſuch ſimple ſoules as I am, who when they haue ſatiſfied
their wicked deſire, report it amongeſt their companions,
to the great reproche and vtter ſpoyle of thoſe that were ſo
fonde to beleue them. But rather then any ſuche thinge
ſhoulde happen to me, I deſire to die the moſte gréeuous
death that may be deuiſed, knowing rightwel, that when a
woman hath once loſt her good name, ſhe hath then no
more to looſe, the ſame being the onely riches that ſhe can
haue in this world. It is therefore very méete that we be
ſomwhat circumſpect in this matter, &amp; if the loue you beare
vnto me, be ſo perfect as you profeſſe, and that your mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ninge
be none other then I imagine it, you may demaund
me of my Father in marriage who I am well aſſured will
not deny you your honeſt requeſt. By this meanes you
may eaſely obteyne your deſire and keepe my good name vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſpotted,
which is the thing wherein I cheifly delight me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hannibal</hi> was well ſatiſfied with theſe words, and
greatly co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mending the vertuous care ſhe had for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruation
of her good name, promiſed ſo ſone as he had
recouered his health to do as ſhe had directed him. After
this <hi>Hannibal</hi> proued all meanes to procure his health,
and being well recouered cauſed certayn of his frendes to
moue his ſute to <hi>Camillas</hi> Father, who knowing his ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility,
and liking well of the offer, aunſwered that he could
be well contented to beſtowe his daughter vpon him, but
would not reſolue vpon any thinge till his Sonne (whoſe
name was <hi>Claudius)</hi> were retorned from <hi>Rome</hi> which he
ſaide would be verie ſhortly.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Camilla</hi> knowing her Fathers anſwer imagined the
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:25404:8"/>
matter to be fully concluded for ſhe thought aſſuredly that
her brother would not be agaynſt it, wherefore betakinge
her ſelfe wholy to her frend <hi>Hannibal,</hi> her affection to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
him grew ſo great that it was nothing inferior vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
his.</p>
               <p>Whilſt <hi>Claudius</hi> deferred his coming from <hi>Rome</hi> to
<hi>Ceſena,</hi> vpon ſome occaſion of buſines that detained him
longer then he thought for, theſe two louers diuers tymes
had conference together, thinking by that meanes ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
to aſwage the amorouſe flame, that continually bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
in theire breſtes, but this cauſed it more and more to
increaſe, and made them thinke euerie hower a yeare till
<hi>Claudius</hi> retorned. But when they ſawe he ſtayed ſo long
after his tyme apoynted, they cauſed themſelues to be
ſecretly maried thinking to celebrat the mariage at <hi>Clau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius</hi>
retorne, who cominge home ſhortly after was aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed
by his Father of the aliaunce that <hi>Hannibal</hi> ſoughte
to haue with him, which (vpon what occaſion I know not)
he greatly miſliked and would in no wiſe geue his conſent
therunto: perſwading his Father very earneſtly for diuers
cauſes that he thought reaſonable, to breake of this match
and in no wiſe to ſuffer it to go forward, wherin the old
man folowinge his Sonnes aduiſe, did in all things as he
deſired him, and anſwered <hi>Hannibals</hi> frends accordingly
when they came to know his reſolution in the matter.</p>
               <p>The two louers vnderſtanding how contrary to their
expectacion al things were fallen out, (as it is our humane
nature to deſire that which is moſt denyed vs) more deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
now then at any tyme before to be together, and
frely to enioy each other, <hi>Camilla</hi> ſaid to her beloued <hi>Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibal:</hi>
what, are not we handfaſt? can we be put a ſonder
with a ſafe conſcience? no verely, and therefore to make
the matter more aſſured (as I may very well without of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
to Godward) I will this night admit you to my bed:
wherefore if about midnight you will repaire to my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
houſe, my maide that is alredie priuy to all that hath
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:25404:9"/>
paſſed betwene vs, ſhall geue her attendaunce at the back
gate to let you in, when you come, whereunto <hi>Hannibal</hi>
verie glad of ſo good an offer, willingly conſented, and
when the hower was come, went with all ſpeede to the
place appoynted, and was priuely conducted by the maid
to <hi>Camillas</hi> chamber who receiued him very courteouſly,
and he imbraſing and kiſſing her with great affection, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſhed
with exceding ioy, through this his vnexpected plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
his ſences failing him, he pittifully dyed in the armes
of his deare <hi>Camilla,</hi> who ſeing this ſtraunge aduenture,
twixte feare and grefe, was ſo grieuouſlie tormented that
being vnhable longe to endure it, at the laſt ſhe fell doune
deade vpon the corpes of her beloued <hi>Hannibal.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The pore maide that was preſent, behoulding this pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull
tragedie, and ſéeing no hope of recouerie in them,
cried for helpe ſo loud as ſhe could. <hi>Claudius</hi> that lay not
farre of, being awakened with this ſodaine clamour, came
running into his ſiſters chamber with his weapons rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
drawne in his hand, to ſee what was the cauſe thereof,
and beholding there this pitifull ſpectacle, knowing it was
the bodie of <hi>Hannibal</hi> that then lay by his ſiſters, not ſtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inge
to heare what the mayde would ſay to him, preſently
ſtabbed her in with his dagger, and ſo leauing her for dead
retourned againe to his owne chamber.</p>
               <p>In the morning this ſtraunge accident being noyſed
throughout the whole towne, and at the laſt coming to the
eares of the Gouernour, he cauſed the mayd to be exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned

               <p>
                  <hi>A</hi> Certaine Prince (whoſe name I nede not rehearſe)
ſoiorning for his pleaſure in the towne of <hi>Blais,</hi> had
amongeſt all his folowers one that he ſpecially fauoured,
who walking one day abroad for his pleaſure, beheld by
chaunce a very bewtifull gentlewoman, that was wyfe
to a welthie merchant of the Toune, and findinge in her
(as he thought) ſo many good giftes, as he neuer ſawe in
any in all his lyfe before, he became ſo greatly enamoured
of her, that he could neuer be in quiet, but was continualy
troubled in mind, practiſing by all meanes poſſible to find
a remedie for his newe paſſion, and ſo behaued him ſelfe
that the gentlewoman well perceyuing his purpoſe &amp; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
va<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>quiſhed with the like affection, did by her lookes and
ieſtures geue him playnly to vnderſtand, that ſhe liked
wel of his frendly offers, and would willingly ſatiſfie his
deſire, if oportunitie did ſerue.</p>
               <p>Duringe theſe hopes the Prince his maiſter made a
ſolemne feaſt, whereunto were aſembled all the Ladies &amp;
gentlewomen of any reputation in the Cittie, amongeſt
whome this gentlewoman before ſpoken of, was one, who
for her bewty, neatenes in apparel and comely behauiour,
did as far ſurmount the reſt, as the prettie pigion doth the
fowle black rauen, or the faireſt ſpring, the filthieſt pudle:
to be ſhort there was no compariſon betwene them, ſo
greatly did they differ in all thinges: which the youthful,
Prince perceyuing, and wondringe greately at ſuch excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
bewtie, as ſhe on the other ſide did at his royaltie, and
the rare perfections that ſhe perceyued to be in him, loue
by and by atached both theire hartes, and inflamed them
with ſuch affection each towards other, that they inſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:25404:10"/>
deſired a ſpedie end of their amorous procedings, and ſo
finely they handled the matter, that before they parted, it
was concluded betwene them, that the next night (her hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſband
being from home) they would mete at her houſe,
and ſatiſfie each other, with full aſſurance of theire vnfai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
amitie.</p>
               <p>The loue of this gentlewoman beinge thus remoued
from the Seruant to the Maiſter, the laſt ſtode ſo greatly
in her grace that the firſt was in a maner quite forgotten,
her ſwete lookes, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uerted to rigorous regards, ſhe now ſet
him at nought, whome before ſhe highly eſtemed, which
ſodaine alteration, ſo tormented the mind of this pore gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman,
and draue him into ſuch extreame paſſions, that
being quite altred from that he was wont to be, he ſemed
rather a deade image, then a liuinge creature. In theſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremities
he withdrue himſelfe into his chamber, and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
his lute in hand, ſonge thereunto as foloweth:
<q>
                     <l>Both loue and death are now become my foes:</l>
                     <l>Of libertie hath loue bereft me quite,</l>
                     <l>So death denyes his due to end my woes,</l>

               <p>The Prince his maiſter ſéeing him ſo ſodainly, and
ſtraungely altered, laboured by all meanes poſsible to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand
the cauſe thereof, which the gentleman would
not in any wiſe confeſſe, but ſought to excuſe the matter
as he could, and make his caſe a great deale better then it
was. The Prince therefore ſeeing all his wordes ſpent to
ſmall purpoſe, in ſeeking to perſwade him to manifeſt his
griefe, &amp; perceiuing that the hower approched, wherein he
appoynted to mete with this gentlewoman, whoſe loue he
had ſo lightly purchaſed, being loth to proſecute his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
without the companie and councell of his fauoured
ſeruaunt, whom he had in all thinges found faithfull vnto
him, he ſecretely called him, vnto him, and ſaid. Though I
haue dyuers tymes demaunded the cauſe of thy griefe
(which I imagine to procéede of loue) and can not be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolued
in it, yet for the mutuall amitie that ought to be
betwene vs, I will not conceale any ſecret of mine from
thee: Knowe then for certaine, that I haue of late bene in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trapped
with the loue of a gentlewoman of this towne, ſo
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:25404:11"/>
faire and full of all perfections, as I thinke in all <hi>Europe</hi>
there liueth not her like, whoſe happy company (if fortune
be not too contrary vnto me) I hope to enioy this night at
my pleaſure, wherefore hauinge now reuealed this ſecret
vnto thee, as to him in whom I haue moſt ſpecial affiance,
I pray thee vouchſafe to acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pany me to the place where
ſhe remaineth that is my onely ſolace, and I aſſure thee,
if thou wilt let me vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d what it is that thus troubleth
thy mynd (which I hartely beſeche thee) thou ſhalt fynd me
as redie to ſatiſfie thy deſire in any thinge, and as carefull
to redeme thee from theſe dolors that now depriue thee of
thy natural reſt.</p>
               <p>The gentleman knowing the perfecte goodwill and
vnfained affection that his Lorde and maiſter bare vnto
him, perceyuing alſo by this his profred courteſie how deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
he was of his well doinge, ſhewed him from pointe
to pointe the cauſe of all his grefe proceding of loue, and
the ingratitude of her whom he honored &amp; eſtéemed aboue
all other creatures, being the ſelfe ſame gentlewoman that
his Lord had choſen for his chefeſt frend, which when he
perceyued whether he had cauſe to contemne him or no, I
leaue it to the iudgment of thoſe that be louers, whoſe na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
is, to loth them that ſeke to be pertakers of their loues
or to take from them any part of theire fauour whom they
ſo greatly fancie? Notwithſtanding this wyſe and worthy
prince, preferring the loue of his frend before his own fond
affections, toke a cleane contrary courſe, for conſidering the
miſerable caſe whereunto loue had brought this pore gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman,
he reſolued with him ſelf rather to reſpect his health
then his owne priuat pleaſure, and reſting vpon this deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination
he ſaid to the gentleman as foloweth.</p>
               <p>My frend thoughe I haue nothing in the world ſo dere
and delightfull vnto me, but I could willingly imparte the
ſame with thée, though thou mayſt diſpoſe of my goods as
of thine owne, &amp; c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

yet loue that can alow of no parteners, will not permit vs
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:25404:11"/>
to be both pertakers of the gentlewoman whome we both
deſire, thou art greatly pained for her ſake and I prefer the
pleaſure I might enioy with her before all my worldly trea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſure.
Theſe are two great extremeties, for as the one can
wel be endured, ſo may not the other be wel forborne: Thy
caſe craueth comfort, and my contentment, if thou want
thy will thou art in daunger to periſh, if I bridle my affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
it will brede me ſorow, notwithſtanding ſo great is
the loue I beare vnto thée, that I do rather choſe to depriue
my ſelf of this fauour, then to ſe thée languiſh for lacke of
that which is in my power to graunt thee: Comforte thy
ſelfe therfore caſt of this carefulnes, and deſpaire no more
but count thy ſelf aſſured of that thou ſekeſt, ſhe ſhall be
thyne that beſt deſerueſt her, thou ſhalt enioy her wholy to
thy ſelf, I geue her frely vnto thée, and geue ouer all the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſt
that I had or may haue in her hereafter.</p>
               <p>The pore gentleman hearing theſe kinde words and
perceyuing his owne error, betwixt hope to obtayne his
deſire, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

with al reuerence due to ſo worthy a perſon, not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
how to anſwere or what to imagine, he ſtode as ſtill as
a ſtone, ſtaringe in the princes face, ſheding great aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daunce
of teares, and as one bereft of all his ſenſes vnable
to vtter one only worde a greate while together: At the
laſt coming to him ſelf agayne, with all humilitie he craued
pardon for the offence which he had vnwittingly commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
againſt hys maieſty, proteſting that he would rather
chooſe to die a thouſand deathes if it were poſsible then wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
ſéeke to impeach the leaſt part of his pleaſure.</p>
               <p>The Prince remayning firme in his liberal purpoſe,
after he had ſtudied a while by what meanes he might beſt
beguile the gentlewoman, and bring his frend reliefe, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
found a fitte deuiſe for that purpoſe, he commaunded
the gentleman to attend vpon him, and vpon paine of hys
diſpleaſure to do whatſoeuer he ſhould appoint him, and ſo

lodging, where they were finely receaued at their
comming, by a prety maid, that ſhe had made priuey to her
meaning, who like a good ſeruaunt, carefull of her Miſtres
commaundements, conueyed the Prince very priuely into
her chamber, where ſhe attended his comming, whoſe
frendly welcome &amp; amorous enticements, had ben enough
to moue the chaſteſt mind in the world, to take delight in
her, and forgetting al frends and frendſhip, to betake him
ſelfe wholy vnto her. But this good Prince, whoſe minde
was fully bent to ſéeke the ſafetie of his frend, when he and
the gentlewoman were laid together in the bedde, and the
candle put out, faining as though he riſe to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The gentleman that was now in tharmes of his Lady,
whom he loued ſo dearely, when he had wel ſatiſfied his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire,
and aſwaged his heate, with her ſwete imbracement,
he asked her pleaſantly whether ſhe thought that the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes

then the good hart and loyall ſeruice of a meane gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.</p>
               <p>The gentlewoman hearing his voyce which ſhe knew
very well, perceyuing therby that it was not the Prince
whom ſhe had pleaſured, but the gentleman that ſhe thought
to diſpleaſe and depriue of that fauoure, which his entire affe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tion

               <p>If my wiſdome had bene as greate as my bewtie, I

<pb n="15" facs="tcp:25404:12"/>

life time, hold an open Court and had in his traine, a great
number of gentlemen and Ladies, ſo well accompliſhed in
all perfections, as there was no Prince in Chriſtendome
comparable vnto him, where loue had ſo liuely diſplayed
himſelfe, that it was harde to finde in any other Courte
whatſoeuer, more affectionate ſeruauntes to their Ladies,
then was one gentlema<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of his houſe named <hi>Bariſor,</hi> who
though he were but baſely borne, and little fauoured with
the giftes of fortune, notwithſtanding nature farre more
gracious vnto him, made him in all vertue and beautie ſo
perfect, that without compariſon hee was accounted the
moſt accompliſhed gentleman in the Courte, and had ſuch
aduauntage aboue all other, that aſwell in all manner of
Gentlemanlike exerciſes, as alſo in martiall exploites, hee
alwayes ſhewed himſelfe farre to ſurmount the reſt which
made him to be ſo welbeloued and eſtéemed of euery one,
eſpecially of the Ladies of the court, that by meanes of the
good countenance they gaue him generally, he tooke great
pleaſure oftentimes to beare them company, ſhewing him
ſelfe ſo courteous and ſeruiceable vnto them, that therby he
drew vnto him the hartes of moſt of them.</p>
               <p>In this honourable troupe, there was a Lady named

of euery one ſaue only of her, could no longer forbeare to
ſhew him the like freendly and fauourable countenaunce.
He on the other ſide beholding the delicate complection and
naturall beautie of this worthy Gentlewoman, was in
ſuch ſorte ſurpryſed, that he did in a maner loſe all his ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.
Loue incontinently (during theſe amorous regards)

the force of this new fire, wherewith they were ſo greately
inflamed, which ſo much tormented the minde of the poore
Gentleman, that being on a day al alone in his chamber,
and almoſt out of his wittes through extreame ſorrow, he
caſte him ſelfe downe vpon his bed thinking to recouer

couered with many dark cloudes, and the water troubled

ſo that the boldeſt in the barke, and he that had beſt ſkill
was faine to geue ouer his taſke, and committe all to the

broken all to péeces, againſt a harde rocke, and all that

For <hi>Bariſor</hi> (ſtrengthned by the vehemencye of hys

an inuincible courage leapt into the Sea, and puttinge
himſelfe, to the power and conducte of the tempeſtuous
waues, brake the billowes with his body, as a Dolphin

great diligence of her poore louer, ſayd vnto him: Alas

we ſhall both be drouned: nay ſweete Lady (ſayd <hi>Bari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor)</hi>

ſo great courage, that with the help of the time, and the ſea
which waxed calme againe, he gate to land, in a deſert I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
inhabited by none but wild beaſtes. So ſoone as they
were arryued in this place, they loking back on a ſodaine,
perceiued a huge Lyon hard at their héeles, wherfore thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
that he would haue deuoured them, and ſo with their

with patience, to abide their vnhappy deſtinie, &amp; like
frends to die together. But the cruel beaſt (whether it were
that he had before ſatiſfied himſelfe ſome where els, or that
the heauens had ſo appointed it) contrary to al expectation,
departed from them, without offering them any iniury, or

               <p>When they had eſcaped this daunger, for feare to fall
into the like again, they wandred vp and down thrée whol
dayes together, to ſeek ſome place of ſecuritie, but in al that
time they ſaw no earthly creature, nor found any harbor,
but only the wild deſert, and the maine ſea, that enuironed
it round about, wherefore being extreamely pinched with
hunger, and faint with running, they were conſtrayned to
reſt their féeble bodies, voyd of al natural ſtrength, hard by
the ſea ſide, where being couched together in this miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

foode, and not able to doe any thing but wéepe and ſighe,

on ſhore, to furniſh themſelues of freſh victual, being dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen

dead bodies of theſe deſolate louers, newly deceaſed, but
paſt al recouerie, perceiued by al outward apparance, that
they died for want of foode, wherfore lamenting their caſe
(which ſeemed verie ſtrange vnto them) they buried them
after the beſt maner they might, and then departing from
them, they departed on their purpoſed voyage, where they
made report of this ſtrange accident, and likewiſe in all
other places where they hapned to come, and amongſt the

knowing by this meanes that ſhe had faſted long and muſt
therefore néedes be a hungred, ſet before her ſuch ſimple
fare as ſhe had, and intreated her ſo much that ſhe got her
to eate a litle. <hi>Conſtance</hi> being now ſomewhat refreſhed
aſked the old woman what ſhe was, who aunſwered that
ſhe was of the <hi>Trappany,</hi> and that her name was <hi>Chere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe,</hi>

               <p>The young virgin (though ſhe were greatly gréeued)
yet hearing <hi>Cherepriſe</hi> named, her mind gaue her ſtrait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
that ſhe had heard the name before, not knowing

enquiring any further of her eſtate, to haue compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion

keepe her ſelfe from receauing any iniurie, which the good
old woman promiſed her to do: Wherefore leauing her a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone
in the houſe, ſhe went with all ſpéede to take vp her
nets, &amp; then returning backe againe, when ſhe had foulded
and layd them vp handſomely together, ſhe led <hi>Conſtance</hi>
with her to <hi>Suſe,</hi> where being arriued, ſhe ſayd vnto her.</p>
               <p>My daughter I will bring thée to the houſe of a good
Saracin Ladie, for whom oftentimes I do ſuch buſines as
ſhe ſhall pleaſe to appoint me, ſhe is an old gentlewoman
very wiſe and charitable, I will recomend thée vnto her ſo

and vſe thée as if thou were her owne childe: And for
thy part, when thou art with her, conform thy ſelfe to ſerue
her well and faithfully, that thou maiſt winne her fauour,
and continue it vntill ſuch time as it ſhall pleaſe the Lord
to ſend thée better fortune.</p>
               <p>This ſayd, ſhe brought <hi>Conſtance</hi> to the Ladies pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence,
who when ſhe knew what ſhe was, and vnderſtoode
what had happened vnto her (for <hi>Cherepriſe</hi> had informed
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:25404:19"/>
her therof at large) ſhe earneſtly beheld her and pitying her
caſe, the teares tickled downe her chéekes, then receauing
her into her ſeruice, ſhe kiſſed her, and led her by the hand
into her houſe, where ſhe remained after that amongeſt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
women (without the company of any man) that were
continually imployed aboute diuerſe kindes of curious
workes, that they wrought with the needle, which <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance</hi>
learning in ſhort time beganne to worke amongſt
them, and by her good behauiour and great diligence, won
the fauour not only of her Miſtres, but alſo of other that
were conuerſant with her, who quickely taught her to
vnderſtand and ſpeake their language.</p>
               <p>Whileſt <hi>Conſtance</hi> was remayning at <hi>Suſe,</hi> her loſſe
being greatly lamented in her fathers houſe, it hapned that
in the time of <hi>Mariubdile</hi> Kinge of <hi>Thunes,</hi> there was a
young Lord of a great linage &amp; very puiſant remaining in
<hi>Grenado,</hi> who challenged the realme of <hi>Thunes</hi> to be his
and for that cauſe leauying a huge army, he came to make
warre vpon the King, thinking to driue him out of the
country.</p>
               <p>Theſe thinges comming to the eares of <hi>Martuccio
Gomitto,</hi> who could very well ſpeake the <hi>Barbary</hi> lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage,
when he vnderſtoode that the King ſought to make
himſelfe as ſtrong as he could to withſtand the malice of
his enemy, he ſayd to one of his kéepers: If I might be
permitted to ſpeake with the King, I could geue him ſuch
councell as might eaſely gaine him the victory: The keper
told his Maiſter what <hi>Martuccio</hi> had ſaid, who went in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>continently
to make report thereof to the King, who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded
<hi>Martuccio</hi> to be brought before him, and being
come, aſked him what his councell was: <hi>Martuccio</hi> with
all reuerence aunſwered him in this maner.</p>
               <p>Worthy Prince ſince the time that I haue frequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
your country, I haue alwayes had good regard to the
order of your fight, and perceaue (vnleſſe I be deceaued)
that your greateſt ſtrength co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſiſteth in archers, wherefore
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:25404:20"/>
in any conceite if it might be ſo brought to paſſe, that your
enemies ſhoulde want arrowes, and your people haue
plentie, it muſt nedes be that they ſhall be vanquiſhed and
you haue the victory: In deede ſayd the King if this coulde
be done, we néede not to doubt of the conqueſt. Surely
Syr (ſaid <hi>Martuccio)</hi> if you pleaſe it may eaſely be done
and in this maner. Firſt you muſt cauſe the ſtringes of
your archers bowes to be made a good deale leſſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thoſe
that are commonly vſed, which done you muſt likewiſe
cauſe the notches of their arrowes to be made fit for thoſe
ſtrings, but this moſt be done ſecretly and with ſuch expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicion,
that your enemies haue no vnderſtanding of it, leaſt
by knowing your pollicy, they ſeeke meanes to preuent it.
And this I ſay becauſe you know it is the cuſtome when
the arrowes on either ſide be all ſpent, then to ſtore them
ſelues with thoſe that they receaue from their enemy, and
to returne them backe againe ſo long as the fight endureth:
Now by this deuice that I haue told you, you may haue
great aduauntage of your enemy. For when you haue both
diſcharged all your arrowes one againſt an other, their ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes
being bigge notched, ſhall ſerue your ſmall ſtringes
very well, but your ſmall notched arrowes ſhall not be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to ſerue their great ſtringes, ſo ſhall you haue great
plenty to aſſaile them a freſh, and they none at all to reſiſt
you, by this meanes ye may deale with them, as you liſt,
and they ſhall no way be able to eſcape your handes.</p>
               <p>The king that was a very wiſe Prince, perceauing
howe profitable this councell might be vnto him, cauſed it
with all diligence to be put in execution, and finding it to
fall out to his commoditie, and the confuſion of his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
he greatly commended <hi>Martuccio,</hi> and to ſhew
him ſelfe thankefull for ſo great a benefite, rewarded him
very bountifully, and aduaunced him to great authoritie.</p>

Gomitto</hi> (whom ſhe ſuppoſed to be dead long

him, which by this time was almoſt quite extinct, began
now to kindle a freſh with a new flame, which increaſing
more and more, did quite remoue from her all deſire to
dye, and opening her caſe to the good Lady that ſhe ſerued,
told her that ſhe greatly deſired to go to <hi>Thunes,</hi> to ſatisfie
her eyes with that which her eares had heard, to thend ſhe
might be more aſſured of his ſafety, whoſe welfare ſhe wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed
as her owne. The good Lady greatly commended her,
prouided a barke, and with all ſpéede went with her to
<hi>Thunes,</hi> where at their comming they were honorablie re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaued
by a kinſman of hers that was dwelling there:
where when they were ſetled, ſhe ſent <hi>Cherepriſe</hi> (that
wente thither with her) to harken after <hi>Martuccio:</hi> who
vndeſtoode that he was aliue, and in greate authoritye,
whereof making report to the Lady, ſhe reioyced greatly
at this good newes, and deſired to be the firſt that ſhould
bring tidinges to <hi>Martuccio</hi> of the welfare of his frend
<hi>Conſtance,</hi> and of her being in the country, went one day
to the place where he lodged, and deſiring to ſpeake with
him, was permitted to come vnto him, to whom ſhe ſayd.
<hi>Senior Martuccio</hi> there is a ſeruant of yours that came
from <hi>Lippare,</hi> arriued at my houſe, whoſe deſire is to haue
ſome conference with you, and becauſe I would not truſt
any other (as ſhe requeſted me) I am come my ſelfe to do
the meſſage vnto you: <hi>Martuccio</hi> thanked her and went
with her to her lodging, where ſhe left <hi>Conſtance,</hi> who
ſéeing that her deare frend <hi>Martuccio</hi> was rauiſhed with
excéeding ioy, and not able to bridle her affection leaped ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainly
about his necke, &amp; imbraced him with open armes,
but the remembraunce of the paſſed paines, and the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
ſhe conceaued in her preſent fortune, did ſo bereaue
her ſenſe, that ſhe could not vtter one word, nor reframe
from ſhedding teares in great aboundance.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Martuccio</hi> beholding her whom he ſo dearely loued,
the caſe ſéemed ſo ſtraunge, and ſo greatly amazed him,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:25404:21"/>
that he ſtoode in doubt a great while, whether he ſaw her in
deede, or elſe dreamed that he ſaw her, but when he came
to himſelfe againe, and knew for certaine that it was ſhe
he ſaid vnto her. Alas my deare art thou yet aliue, it is long
ſince that I hard report that thou was loſt, neither could
it be knowen whether thou we<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>teſt, or what was become
of thée. This ſaid, weping bitterly he imbraced and kiſſed
her a thouſand times together. Then did <hi>Conſtance</hi> tell
him of all her aduentures, and how courteouſly the good
Lady had delt with her from time to time, after which and
diuers other talke that they had together, he departed from
thence, and going to the King his Maiſter aduertiſed him
of all that had happened to him and his frend <hi>Conſtance,</hi>
crauing leaue of him to marry her according to his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie
maner: The King greatly marueling at the matter,
ſent for <hi>Conſtance,</hi> who confirming all that <hi>Martuccio</hi>
had reported, he ſaid vnto her: Now truly faire vigin thou
art worthy to haue him to thy huſbande, for whom thou
haſt taken ſuch paines and paſſed ſo many perils: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
beſtowing many large gifts vpon them, he gaue them

very liberally rewarding the Lady for the great bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uolence

ſo chearefully receaued of all their frendes (who neuer
